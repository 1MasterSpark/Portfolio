This was a model level crossing I made with a group for uni. Although I would have preferred C or Python, we had to code it in LabView. Since my laptop was the only one in which LabView worked, I mostly handled the programming and some of the hardware, while my team did the physical model and the rest of the wiring. Please find attached the project report, the project's VI and a demonstration video of the working project
