# Personal Projects
Here is a selection of some personal projects I have worked on, from simplest to most complex.
## Eulerian Problem
A challenge given to my by a maths professor at university involved calculating the number of Eulerian cycles that can be created in a connected graph, assuming that, at every vertex, the cycles always cross over to the "opposite" line. I wrote this simple python script to demonstrate the problem. The code is well-commented. To test it, first install pygame using the following command:
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

Then run [this file](Eulerian%20Problem/eulerianproblem.py). You can add points, then add lines connecting those points, then press "Count loops" to watch the program count and colour-code the different Eulerian cycles created.

## Doctor's Website
I created a static website for my father at [drmamdoohsaleh.com](https://drmamdoohsaleh.com/) using CSS, JavaScript, and a free-to-use Wordpress theme, hosting it with AWS Lightsail.
