# Personal Projects
Here is a selection of some personal projects I have worked on, from simplest to most complex.
## Eulerian Problem
In my first year of uni, my maths professor gave me a challenge involving the number of Eulerian cycles that can be created in a connected graph, assuming that, at every vertex, the cycles always cross over to the "opposite" line. I wrote this simple python script to demonstrate the problem. The code is well-commented. To test it, first install pygame using the following command:

    pip install pygame

Then run [this file](Eulerian%20Problem/eulerianproblem.py). You can add points, then add lines connecting those points, then press "Count loops" to watch the program count and colour-code the different Eulerian cycles created.

This was one of my earliest works, but I am still proud of it.

## Doctor's Website
I created a static website for my father at [drmamdoohsaleh.com](https://drmamdoohsaleh.com/) using CSS, JavaScript, and a free-to-use Wordpress theme, hosting it with AWS Lightsail.

I am also currently working on my own website to host my Portfolio on instead of Github.

## Wikipedia
As a hobby, I have created several projects on Wikipedia that I am proud of. Some of these include:
- A template that calculates current date in the Coptic (Ancient Egyptian) calendar. For more on this, click [here](Coptic%20Calendar/).
- [The ultimate shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ILoveHirasawaYui) for my favourite fictional character, designed in a retro, GeoCities-esque style. Wikipedia strictly bans Javascript and copyrighted images, so I had to be creative. It includes random facts and quotes, and a map of 184 anime pilgrimage sites.
- This page on the [Chalcedonian Schism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcedonian_Schism) which took over two months of historical research. I have also written [many other](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&target=ILoveHirasawaYui&namespace=0&tagfilter=mw-new-redirect&tagInvert=1&newOnly=1), much shorter articles.

## PC Building
I have built two PCs, acquiring expertise in both hardware and software. My first PC was made with entirely brand new parts, and has the following specs:
- CPU: [Ryzen 7 5700X](https://www.scorptec.com.au/product/cpu/amd-socket-am4/96439-100-100000926wof)
- Motherboard: [ASRock B550M-HDV](https://www.scorptec.com.au/product/motherboards/amd-socket-am4/83472-b550-phantom-gaming-4-ac)
- RAM: [32GB DDR4](https://www.scorptec.com.au/product/memory/ddr4-desktop-memory/97204-kf432c16bbk2-32)
- GPU: [Radeon RX 9060XT](https://www.scorptec.com.au/product/graphics-cards/amd/118609-rx-96tsw8gwq)
- SSD: [2TB NVMe](https://www.scorptec.com.au/product/hard-drives-&-ssds/solid-state-drives-(ssd)/98797-ct2000p3pssd8)
- PSU: [650W](https://www.scorptec.com.au/product/power-supplies/atx/107664-gp-p650g)
- Network Card: [TP-Link AX3000 Archer TX3000E](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07YVNM1WX)

My second build used an old ASRock H110M-HDV with a broken RAM channel that my friend had lent me. I had to first run a BIOS update before putting in the new RAM. I now use that as my server PC.

## Homelab
I have gained tremendous experience in networking and as a system administrator through the countless hours I have spent building and improving my homelab.
### Genshin Server
In 
### Minecraft Server
I have my own Minecraft server. My most impressive build is a 2:1 scale model of the Second Temple, which I created over years using both primary and secondary sources, as well as commands and mods. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSC41ceTQX8) is a video demonstrating it.

### Jellyfin Server
### SMB Server
