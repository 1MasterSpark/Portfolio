This was some code I wrote to figure out a maths problem involving the number of Eulerian cycles that can be created in a connected graph, assuming that, at every vertex, the cycles always cross over to the line on the "opposite" side. The code demonstrates the problem well.

To see the code, first install pygame using this command:
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

Then run the file. You can add points, then add lines connecting those points

There are comments explaining the code. I added those for the mathematics professor at my uni who encouraged me to pursue this problem.
