This code was all written for a unit I did in 2023 in Object Oriented Programming, specifically using C#. I have filtered it to only include the four best programs I wrote for that unit. Below are some explanations of each directory here:

* commadprocessor contains a text-based RPG I made in which the player can use the commands look and move to explore the world. The player also has an inventory and can interact with objects in it, or with the world. There is a video demonstration of it in the directory

* researchproject is, as its name would suggest, a research project about whether procedural or object-oriented paradigms are more effective at solving repetitive mathematical problems

* tetris is just an implementation of tetris in C#, including a highscore saving feature and the ability to hold tetrominos. It also includes a demonstration video I made partly through its development

* saving is a drawing program that allows the user to draw squares, circles and lines. Its name comes from the fact that it has a save feature. Like the others, it comes with a demonstration video
