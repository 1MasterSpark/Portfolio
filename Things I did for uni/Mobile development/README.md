These are three mobile applications I made in Android Studio using Java and Kotlin:
	Assignment 1 is a score counter for rock climbing
	Assignment 2 is a proof-of-concept app for a musical instrument rental company
	Assignment 3 is an exercise tracker app that has CRUD functions and uses a database to save the user's data

All three apps have reports- feel free to read them. The source code was added as zip files due to Github's limitations on file systems.
