In 2022, I wrote some code in Markdown to create two templates that would display the current date and year in the Coptic calendar. This is currently used in many Wikipedia pages, such as these two:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_calendar
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_the_Martyrs

The code for these templates can be seen in these links (please do not actually edit them):
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:COPTICDATE&action=edit&oldid=1123386201
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:COPTICYEAR&action=edit

copticdate.html is a demonstration of that code, after I tediously converted it to javascript.
